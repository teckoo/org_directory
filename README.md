==================
org_directory
==================

This app provides an online directory for organizations.
Users can view/search the basic information of groups and people
in the organization.

Meanwhile I use this app to practice and demo my Django knowledge.

* Source control: git. I use github to publish the code base on Internet.
  At work, I use subversion, IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC), and Borland StarTeam.

Packages
---------
* localflavor, since ver 1.5, localization to US states, phone etc. See models.py Class Organization
* admin customization
* south, database schema migration
