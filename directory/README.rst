==================
church_directory
==================

This app provides an online directory for local church organizations.
Users can view/search the basic information of group/family/members
in the church.

Meanwhile I use this app to practice and demo my Django knowledge.

* Source control: git. I use github to cooperate with other programmers on Internet.
  At work, I use subversion, IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC), and Borland StarTeam.

Packages
---------
* localflavor, since ver 1.5, localization to US states, phone etc. See models.py Class Church.
* mptt, build a tree structure handy.
* admin customization
